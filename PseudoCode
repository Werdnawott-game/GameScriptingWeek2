PseudoCode
\\\\\\\\\\

1. Convert a string input to all caps
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

initialize stringInput
initialize boolCheck = false

do
  get user input into stringInput

  while next char in string exists
    if char is a number
      set bool check to true
      say "please input a new string without numbers"

while boolCheck is true

while next char in string exists
  convert to caps through a prebuilt function
  or using ascii decrement by 22

print string input now CAPS


2. Add two numbers
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

initialize num1, num2, and sum

do
  get user input for num1
  get user input for num2

  if num1 or num2 are not numbers
    say "please only input numbers

while num1 and num2 ar not numbers

sum = num1 + num2;

print sum;


3. Get an unknown amount of numbers and sum them
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

initialize an int vector or list or other form of expandable array
initilize sum
initilize intInput
initilize inputStop as false

while inputStop is false
  get user input for intInput

  add intInput to end of vector
  ask user if they wish to continue

  if yes
    inputStop is false
  else
    inputStop is true

sum = vector head

while intVector next is not null
  sum += next

print sum


4. Have the user define a maximum number and get a random output between their number and 0
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

initilize ranMax
initilize inputStop as false

get user input for ranMax

do
  generate a random number between 0 and ranMax
  ask user if they would like to go again
  if yes
    set inputStop to false
  else
    set inputStop to True
while inputStop is false


5. Get a random number and print right if it is even and left if it is odd, repeat 10 times
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

initilize curNum
initilize rNum = 0 and lNum = 0

for(i = 0, i < 10, i++)
  curNum = rand(1, 100)

  if curNum % 2 = 0
    print RIGHT
    rNum++;
  else 
    print LEFT
    lNum++;

print lNum
print rNum
